HOW WE WILL STORE THE DATA:

There will be four files for the users, one for each role:
one file for Supervisors
one file for Administrators
one file for Instructors
one file for TAs

*The users within the files will be organized in alphabetical order

Each user will contain their user information:
First name, Last name, username, password, role, phone, email, address, courses, labs, assignments (if no assignments, write none)

*if multiple courses, labs, or assignments, they are seperated by commas. ','

The user files themselves will be organized like so:
There will be a two code strings to separate users
Start of user = "!@#$"
End of user   = "$#@!"          (we may use a loop instead, but proceed for now)


So an example file will look like this:

!@#$                            //start of user 1
James                                       //firstname
Peterson                                    //lastname
jkpeter                                     //username
hello123                                    //password
Instructor                                  //role

When the program needs information for a particular user, it will go to their
designated file (based on their role) and search for them
